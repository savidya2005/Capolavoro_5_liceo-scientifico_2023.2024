          I have a passion to music, for me music is a form of escape from the monotony of some activities I do daily and it gives me a sort of energy to face the day.
          I enjoy listening to international pop music. Some of the pop artists I often listen are Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Sabrina Carpenter, Rihanna, Shawn Mendes. 
          My favourite pop singer is Ariana Grande and my favourite Italian singer is Annalisa. 
          Even though I was born in Italy, since a young age I used to listen to my parents' favourite artists and their songs. 
          Therefore I am fond of Sri Lankan Classical music as it always reminds me about my childhood. As well, I can impersonate myself in many Sri Lankan Classic songs.
          I love listening to Hindi and Tamil songs too. 
          I like singing very much when I'm alone.
          At school I joined the school's chorus for the last high school's three years. This school activity had given me a great experience in facing some of my weaknesses.
          I am a soprano and during school's concerts I sang both along with the chorus and alone.
